# Fabric Example Mod

## Discription

This is a ___Minecraft Fabric___ mod which lets the player control the camera with numpad/keypad keys.

**_Note:- This does not work like bedrock right now. The player does not rotate by 45 degrees instead it makes the player look at the block at 45 degrees._**
